SMS Calculator

This is my first practice program using the Twilio API. It uses PHP sessions
to add, subtract, multiply or divide two numbers. 

To run the program, you will need a Twilio account with a phone number, and
a web server with the Twilio PHP helper library installed on it (available at
https://twilio.com/docs/libraries/php ).

response.php must be hosted on your web server. Then point your Twilio phone
number to trigger response.php when the phone number receives an SMS. (Go to 
https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming and click on your number).
